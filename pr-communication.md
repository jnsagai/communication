Title: Fix lint, CodeQL coverage and finding links; normalize license headers

Buildifier warnings currently escape the formatter check, the nightly extraction
can omit production implementation dependencies, and the type-alias MISRA query
can emit unusable `file:/` related links. This change makes warnings fail the lint
job, audits every configured production C++ compilation input after extraction,
and replaces the affected query with a location-preserving correction.

It also exposes the existing Communication AoU target through a public alias,
with a native forwarding fixture and one original TRLC source. The restricted
target and original AoU IDs are retained. A separate Config Management proposal
demonstrates real provider consumption; its full safety index remains blocked.

For #1031, this contribution covers public AoU visibility, the forwarding
regression fixture and measured provider consumption. Production safety decisions
are deferred to a separate Config Management follow-up: shared-memory adequacy,
the consuming requirement's QM classification against the ASIL B AoU, dispositions
for every received AoU, and correction of placeholder safety records with real
implementation/verification links. The passing API/provider checks establish
technical consumption only. Full consumer FMEA/LOBSTER/index validation,
including duplicate processing and complete forwarding, remains incomplete.
Use `Related` for #1031; keep the issue open until its remaining acceptance
criteria are met. The Config Management companion remains a draft proposal.

- Adds positive and negative buildifier fixtures and repairs observed warnings.
  Rust unit-test compatibility constraints are forwarded rather than discarded.
- Includes external implementation dependencies in the extraction closure;
  rejects missing compilation sources and nonempty failed database retries.
- Retains CodeQL 2.21.4, MISRA 2.62.0 and locked libraries. The corrected query
  keeps its original predicates, rule ID and primary locations. Located aliases
  link to their definitions; locationless instances link to the actual type-name
  use selected by the query.
- Adds Bash shebangs to all six rules_build_error 0.11.0 helpers so expected
  compiler failures remain testable under CodeQL tracing. The pin and CC0
  licensing remain unchanged; the imported query retains its MIT license.

Validation and exact source bindings are in `verification.md` and
`required-checks.json`. The retained exact-scope comparison has 501 findings
before/after, removes 281 empty URI occurrences, and preserves primary findings,
fingerprints, alias descriptions and previously located related links. Two
merged messages expand because restored locations distinguish link targets.
The final licensed-source database covers 516/516 configured C++ inputs,
with exact source-byte matches. All 218 queries and native reports pass;
2127 findings remain for native disposition, with zero empty file URIs.
Host tests report 508 passes and 7 explicit skips. Full build, formatting,
buildifier and complete-repository copyright checks pass. The code-file audit
also covers query suites, templates, fixtures and packet helpers outside the
native checker. Existing numeric years, MIT attribution and CC0 terms remain.
Generated action bundles retain their third-party notices and receive project
license banners during regeneration.

Close individual issues only after their native acceptance criteria are met.

The lint job implements the existing Bazel formatting/linting obligation in
CI.md and provides a local reproduction command. Codeowner review must assess
the workflow change and its performance in native CI. Hosted
lint/sanitizer/platform results, ECA and native safety/dependency approval remain
explicit gates; this draft does not waive them.
